      <p>Thank you for contacting me.</p>
      <p>
        I'm not actively looking for a career change, although I would be open to considering roles that represent a
        significant step forward in my career (such as <strong>Staff Engineer</strong>, <strong
          >Principal Engineer</strong
        >, or other <strong>leadership roles</strong>), and opportunities that offer a strong overall package. To make
        things easier, I have prepared a detailed text that will save us both a lot of time and back-and-forth emails.
        Please feel free to read it and learn more about me, what I'm looking for, how I can contribute to your
        organization, what I do well, what I like and what I don't, and much more.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium leading-relaxed mb-8 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Who am I</h2>
      <p>
        You can learn all about me in the <strong
          ><a href="/about" target="_blank" class="font-bold">about section of this site</a></strong
        >.

      <p>
        Please feel free to learn more about me by navigating this site and checking <strong

        a look at my <strong><a href="https://github.com/tsevdos" target="_blank" class="font-bold">GitHub</a></strong>
        and <strong><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~tsevdos" target="_blank" class="font-bold">npm</a></strong>

        What kind of company I'm looking for
      </h2>
      <p>
        I'm looking for an established, stable company that already has a product or service - ideally a SaaS product.
        I'm not a big fan of agencies or companies that deal with short-term projects, because in many cases they don't
        fully embrace code quality, best practices, testing, scalability, maintainability, and all the principles that
        create a great <strong>developer experience (DX)</strong>. Their main concern is often to hand over the project,
        get paid, and move on to the next one.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have worked on such projects in the past, and unfortunately, you miss much of the joy and satisfaction of <strong
          >growing and scaling a product</strong
        > — and of course, growing and scaling your skills with it. I would also prefer a company that appreciates its engineering
        team, supports them, and respects work-life balance.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium leading-relaxed mb-8 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Work-related</h2>
      <p>
        I'm based in <strong>Athens, Greece (EU)</strong>, and I can work remotely (<strong
          >Eastern European Time</strong
        >). Unfortunately, relocation is not an option for me. I am looking for <strong>full-time</strong> roles.
      </p>
      <p>Please also note the benefits below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>25 days of leave per year</li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.officeholidays.com/countries/greece/2026" target="_blank">Greek bank holidays</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium leading-relaxed mb-8 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        What I love and do well
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Running and supporting a team (Scrum team)</li>
        <li>Clean architecture, best practices, performance, and scalability</li>
        <li>Problem-solving and debugging</li>
        <li>Pair programming</li>
        <li>Code reviews</li>
        <li>Training and mentoring</li>
        <li>Automation</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium leading-relaxed mb-8 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        What I don't really enjoy
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Bureaucracy</li>
        <li>Spaghetti code</li>
        <li>Dark patterns</li>
        <li>
          Over the years, I’ve tended to write less and less styling (CSS). Don't get me wrong — I’ve written tons of
          CSS in my career, from positioning elements using old-school tables and pure box-model techniques up to flexbox and
          grid layouts. Tools and technologies like Tailwind, CSS Modules, CSS-in-JS, and, of course, components have
          made our lives easier. However, I always prefer working on TypeScript and JavaScript modules and components
          rather than styling them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium leading-relaxed mb-8 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Compensation</h2>
      <p>
        Things are a bit complicated here, depending on whether you can hire me in Greece or contract (freelance) me —
        so I don't have a clear answer yet. I'd definitely consider offers ranging from €80,000 to €100,000 per year.

      <p>Thank you for your time and understanding!</p>
