Hi all, after the very successful [Gulp boilerplate for web designers](/blog/javascript/gulp-boilerplate-for-web-designers/) and [Grunt boilerplate for web designers](/blog/javascript/grunt-boilerplate-for-web-designers/), I’m very pleased to announce my **[React boilerplate](https://github.com/tsevdos/react-boilerplate)** (it’s as designers friendly as it can be).

It comes with **ES6** and **ESlint** out of the box, and with a **webpack** configuration that you can actually understand and built on top of it. Feel free to fork, download and play with it!
