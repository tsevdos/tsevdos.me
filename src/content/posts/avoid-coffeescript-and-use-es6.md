Those of you that follow my blog might have noticed how fond I am to some of CoffeeScript's conveniences. They are excellent, but it's time to leave them behind and start using [ES6](http://es6-features.org/). Most of [CoffeeScript's goodies already exist in ES6 (with some syntax changes)](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/replace-coffeescript-with-es6), and your code is guaranteed to be future proof. And if time spent learning CoffeeScript feels like a waste, there's good news - with a solid CoffeeScript base, transitioning to ES6 will be a piece of cake!
